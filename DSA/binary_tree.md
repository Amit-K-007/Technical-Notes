- Problem: Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

---

- **Algorithm**: Use a stack to simulate recursive preorder traversal
- Process current node first → add value to result
- Push right child before left child
- Stack is LIFO, so left subtree gets processed first
- Continue until all nodes are visited
